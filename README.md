# Self-introduction  
HiðŸ˜†  
I am a university student living in Japan.
My favorite things to do are to watch movies and to think of systems that might be useful to people. I've been doing programming for image processing systems, and the language I can do best is *Python*. I can also program in *C, Java(?), html, and css*. I've used [**MATLAB**](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [**ROS**](http://wiki.ros.org/Documentation) in the past.  

I also created my circle's [blog](https://kuclubdtk.hateblo.jp), a place where everyone of it can do [activities](https://github.com/DTK-CreativeStudio) and [learnings](https://github.com/DTK-CreativeStudio/Course) online. And did [a special site](https://kudtk844412490.wordpress.com) for my Universityâ€™s festival (including videos).

Recently, I've been into [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com), and I've created  
a part of [walklets.com](https://walklets.com) (Docker-based AI image processing service)  
and the [U.N.I.O.N.](https://github.com/DTK-CreativeStudio/U.N.I.O.N.) (access control system).

My Career (Not in chronological order)

- I collaborated with a friend
to develop [**walklets.com**](https://walklets.com).

- I have studied abroad in Australia and Taiwan.
- Won the Excellence Award at *TGL College 2019 Development Contest*
- Runner-up in the [***AWS Robot Delivery Challenge***](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/robot-delivery-challenge/) finals
- Won the "AI Trend" Award of [***intel three challenges***](https://webinar.intel.com/IntelAIPark#openvino) in [**intel AI Park**](https://webinar.intel.com/IntelAIPark)
- Organized events for my university student.
  (We went to visit [Spring 8](http://www.spring8.or.jp/en/) and the supercomputer [K computer(äº¬)](https://www.fujitsu.com/jp/about/businesspolicy/tech/k/whatis/project/#nickname). I contacted several companies or organizations for quotes on places to visit, accommodations, and bus arrangements. I also produced posters and pamphlets  and so on).
